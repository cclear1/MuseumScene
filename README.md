# How to use #

## Run the program ##
In terminal simply run the following commands
* javac *.java
* javac Museum

## The GUI ##
The following describes the operation of each button
* Sun - this enables/disables the direction light (sun). The sun intensity and sky texture work on 
  a cycle and disabling the sun will not stop the texture change cycle.
* Lightswitch - this enables/disables the point light
* Spotlight - this enables/disables the spotlight. It will remain swinging once off.
* PoseX - the pose buttons move the robot to pose X. If it is already in said pose the robot will 
  not move. If the pose is not adjacent it will visit an adjacent pose position before then moving 
  to pose X. Once a pose button has been triggered the other pose buttons will not operate until 
  the robot has stopped moving.
